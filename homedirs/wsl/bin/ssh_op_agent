  # I can't figure out what good defaults would look like. There are so many

  # called "keychain" whith many private key fields hanging off of it. I am
  # preferring NOT to use the "notesPlain" value because I prefer to use that
  # for Item metadata and other misc information.
  #
  # 1 Passwords strength is its great flexibility, but it also imposes a lot
  # of decision making to be done.

  # Another consequence of using fields is that the key needs to be base64
  # encoded because fields cannot be multi-line.

  # The string used to fetch the field also doesn't need to be the same as the
  # string that is displayed through the 1 Password GUI. This could make
  # discoverability quite hard to other tools don't keep these values the same.

usage: $0 <command> <args>

Grabs ssh keys from 1 Password and stores them in your ssh-agent. Currently
this only works with Secure Notes because of the way 1 Password structures
its data internally.

Commands:
 - load
     adds a secure note into your ssh-agent

     -n      specify the name of the item (default: "keychain")

     -f      specify the field of the key; needs to be base64 encoded (default: "base64 encoded ssh private key")

     -p      specify the field (assuming the same note specified with -n) containing the key's passphrase (optional)

     -t      specify a timeout in hrs (default: 1)

Examples:

ssh_op_agent load -n test -f "base64 encoded ssh private key" -p "ssh key passphrase"
USAGE

  exit 1
