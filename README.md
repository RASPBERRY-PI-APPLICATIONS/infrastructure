### DNS



### Decision Log

* Terraform + AWS because it's boring. I'm familiar with both of these technologies already. Thanks
  @jezhumble for this sharing how the [US Government manages DNS][18f-dns]
* `s3` backend for Terraform state because I repave frequently so need to ensure these files are
  stored somewhere safe.
* Separate `terraform` user created with: `IAMFullAccess`, `AmazonS3FullAccess`, and `AmazonRoute53FullAccess`
  policies. Created manually as I wasn't sure how to `terraform` the user that `terraform` runs as. Never used
  the **Access Advisor** before and it's pretty slick!
